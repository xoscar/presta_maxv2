# Prestamax Application

Create and manage loans in an easy way, able to manage clients, loans, payments and charges.

Ways of running the application:

- If you are a docker user, you can run the commands `docker-compose build` and `docker-compose up`, also you can use the dummy data created on `tools/backup/` just by executing the mongodb container and importing it with `mongorestore`.

- Another way of running the app is installing dependencies in both `root` dir and `frontend` plus pm2 and after that you can simply do `npm start`.
